## 🔥 How it Works

- **Encryption:**  
  User selects a file → provides a password → file is encrypted in the browser itself using AES algorithm → encrypted file is downloaded.

- **Decryption:**  
  User uploads an encrypted file → provides the correct password → file is decrypted in the browser → original file is downloaded.

- **Important:**  
  - No file is ever uploaded to any server.
  - All processing happens inside your browser locally.
  - Full privacy and security guaranteed.
